I am a Tenure-Track Associate Professor of [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). Before that, I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC advised by Prof. [Tarek Abdelzaher](http://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/) in 2021; I received my bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. [Fan Wu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/). My research focuses on edge AI, machine intelligence empowered cyber-physical systems (CPS) and real-time systems.

**I am looking for self-motivated students at all levels (Ph.D., M.S., and Undergrad) to work with me. If you are interested in our research, please feel free to reach out to me (shengzhong<at>sjtu.edu.cn).**
