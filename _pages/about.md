I am a postdoc research associate of [Coordinated Science Laboratory](https://csl.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at UIUC advised by Prof. [Tarek Abdelzaher](http://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/) in 2021. Before that, I received my bachelor degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2017, under the supervision of Prof. [Fan Wu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/). My research focuses on edge AI, machine intelligence empowered cyber-physical systems (CPS) and real-time systems.
